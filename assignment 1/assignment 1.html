The Tsugla Lopen of the Central Monastic Body, the Home Minister and representatives from Nyingma institutions attended the day-long ceremony. The day marks the 499th death anniversary of the great treasure discoverer.

<b>The event began with the unfurling of the country’s largest 42-feet-tall applique or Thongdrel of Terton Pema Lingpa, which was built in 2018. After lighting butter lamps before a statue of the Great Treasure Revealer, it was followed by the Pacham dance (dance of the heroes). It’s also believed that Pacham was first introduced by Pema Lingpa after witnessing such a dance in his visionary journey to Zangdo-pelri.

As the prayer of supplication began, mask dances of Gods Tsampa and Bjajin were performed. Various rituals have been conducted throughout the day in memory of the passing of the Treasure Revealer. People were also given a book containing prayers composed by the spiritual master. The day has been marked following an executive order from the cabinet.

<em>“Pema Lingpa is the heart son of Guru Rinpoche who once took birth as Kuenkhen Longchen Rabjam, one of the greatest Nyingma masters. He is also one of the five King Treasure Discoverers and the root of the Wangchuck Dynasty. Pema Lingpa passed away at Tamshing monastery with this huge legacy. We greatly appreciate the government’s initiative in observing the day,” said Ngodup Dorji, a Nyingma Representative.</em>

The day has been marked at Tamshing monastery as it is the main seat of Terton Pema Lingpa, which was built in 1505. He also passed away in this monastery in 1521. The day will now be marked annually to pay homage to the Treasure Discoverer who has played a significant role in shaping the religious and cultural traditions of Bhutan.

“We are really thankful to all stakeholders involved such as the Choeday Lhuentshog and Home Ministry for officially observing the first-ever day dedicated to honouring Tertoen Pema Lingpa. We hope to see the day is marked with equal importance and reverence in other Peling festivals and occasions every year,” said Tsheltrim Loday, from the Tamshing Monastery.

Terton Pema Lingpa was born at Baribrang in Tang valley of Bumthang about 570 years ago. He spent his life revealing treasures initially in Bumthang, which eventually spread to other parts of Bhutan and Southern Tibet. He also wrote various prayers and texts, which would become the heritage of his sacred speech. Today, the teachings of Pema Lingpa are considered the most invaluable religious collection of the country.
